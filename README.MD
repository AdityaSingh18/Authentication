User Authentication System Documentation
Overview


This documentation covers the implementation of a secure user authentication system built with Node.js and Express. The system supports user registration and login functionalities,
employing modern web development practices and ensuring adherence to industry standards for security and data integrity.


Features
User Registration
•	Users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
•	User data is securely stored in a MongoDB database.
•	Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before saving to the database.
•	Server-side data validation ensures data integrity.
User Login
•	Users can log in using their username/email and password.
•	Upon successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated containing relevant user information (excluding sensitive data like passwords).
Security
•	The system includes protection against XSS and injection attacks using well-known libraries.
•	User input is sanitized to prevent vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Evaluation Criteria
•	Functionality: The system includes registration, login, and JWT generation.
•	Code Quality: The code is well-structured, readable, maintainable, and follows coding principles like SOLID and DRY.
•	Security: Best practices for password storage, token handling,  and input sanitization are implemented.
•	Design: The overall architecture is well-designed and scalable.
•	Error Handling: Strategies for handling invalid login attempts, registration errors, etc.
•	Documentation: Clear documentation explaining the approach and design choices.

Dependencies
•	Express: Web framework for Node.js.
•	Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool.
•	bcryptjs: Library for hashing passwords.
•	dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
•	jsonwebtoken: Library for generating and verifying JWTs.
•	cors: Middleware for enabling CORS.
•	body-parser: Middleware for parsing JSON request bodies.


Installation
1.	Install dependencies:

npm install
2.	Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

PORT=3000
MongoDB=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
3.	Start the server:


npm start
API Endpoints
User Registration
•	URL: /api/signup
•	Method: POST
•	Body:
json

{
  "username": "your_username",
  "email": "your_email",
  "password": "your_password"
}
•	Response:
o	201 Created: User successfully registered.
o	400 Bad Request: Validation errors or user already exists.
User Login
•	URL: /api/signin
•	Method: POST
•	Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "email": "your_email",
  "password": "your_password"
}
•	Response:
o	200 OK: User successfully logged in, returns JWT.
o	400 Bad Request: Validation errors.
o	401 Unauthorized: Invalid credentials.
Code Explanation
models/userModel.js
Defines the Mongoose schema and model for user data.
controllers/userController.js
Contains the logic for handling user registration and login, including validation, password hashing, and JWT generation.
routes/userRoutes.js
Defines the API routes for user registration and login, mapping them to the corresponding controller functions.
middlewares/auth.js
Middleware for protecting routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.
Security Measures
Password Hashing
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database to ensure that plaintext passwords are never stored.
JWT
JWTs are used to authenticate users, ensuring that sensitive data is not included in the token payload.
Input Sanitization
User inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS and injection attacks.
CORS
CORS middleware is used to enable cross-origin requests, with proper configuration to enhance security.
Error Handling
The application includes comprehensive error handling strategies to manage invalid login attempts, registration errors, and other potential issues.
Global Error Handler
A global error handler is included to catch and respond to errors appropriately, logging the errors for debugging purposes.
Conclusion
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the user authentication system, including installation instructions, API endpoints, code explanations, and security measures. The system is designed to be secure, scalable, and maintainable, adhering to modern web development practices and industry standards.
